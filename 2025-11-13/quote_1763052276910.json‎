{"value":"“Life is too short to wake up with regrets. So love the people who treat you<br>right. Forget about those who don’t. Believe everything happens for a reason. If you get a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it. Nobody said life would be easy, they just promised it would most likely be worth it.”-― Harvey MacKay"}
